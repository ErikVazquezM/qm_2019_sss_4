=========================================================

This package calculates the energy of a system of noble gas atoms at the HF-MP2 level.

This package includes modules for :

- Interpreting the orbital based on the orbital orbital index
- Computing the HF energy for a system of Noble Gas atoms
- Computing the MP2 correction to the system
